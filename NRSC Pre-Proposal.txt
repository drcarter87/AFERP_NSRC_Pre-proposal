The ecological challenges facing the Northern Forest are the uncertainties that climate change will
bring to the area. With a robust wood products market and dependence on eco-tourism in the state of Maine, 
an elucidation and a plan to mitigate the impacts of climate change needs to be established. To do so, we
propose a cost:benefit evaluation be done on the long-term silivcultural experiment - the Acadian Forest Ecosystem
Research Project (AFERP) -  at The University of Maine in the Penobscot Experimental Forest. 

Established in 1995, AFERP has accumulated nearly two decades of data. In that time, <insert project description>

Maintaining "complex" systems, and subsequently maintaining multiple successional pathways and strengthening a forest's 
capacity to adapt, is thought to be the most effective preemptive management strategy to brace forests for an uncertain 
future under climate change.
